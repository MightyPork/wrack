WRACK
=====

Wrack is a framework that displays articles stored in folder structure.

Article metadata is stored in YAML files, articles themselves can use MarkDown, HTML or plain text (easy to add more formats).

All articles can have custom stylesheets, scripts, images, downloads etc.

**WRACK is experimental and is not ready for production yet.**
