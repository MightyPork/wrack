**Hey, I'm Ondřej Hruška!**<br>
you may also know me as *MightyPork*.

The nick comes from Minecraft, but I like bacon IRL, too! I also enjoy programming, in any form - except Lisp, because it's weird.

**Here's some bio:**

* I'm 20 years old
* I study *Cybernetics and Robotics* at [ČVUT][cvut] in [Prague][prague]
* I use Linux for all my work, my favourites are Kubuntu, Xubuntu and CrunchBang.
* I used to make Minecraft mods - I'm the founder of *Backpack* and *PowerCraft*
* You can find me on [Twitter][twitter] and [Google+][gplus].
* Also have a look at my [GitHub][github].

*If you want, you can leave some message for me in the comments below.<br>
That applies also to all the articles.*
