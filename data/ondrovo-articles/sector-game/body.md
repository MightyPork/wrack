$ It started as a fun project, and developed into a really good arcade space-shooter, with a wide choice of weapons and gorgeous explosions.

The game of Sector is about building ships and beating powerful enemies with them. It comes with a bunch of challenge levels with shared leader-boards, so you can compare your results with people all over the world!

# Something about the game

Just to put this story into the historical context: the first ideas about making Sector arrived to me in the summer of 2012, and I continued developing the game until the spring of 2013.

The latest version, 1.7, is pretty much the final product.

## The silly plans

I started coding Sector with the idea of making a space adventure, where you build ships, get money to repair them, and then get further, make better ship and so on.

I wanted to make something grand, popular, loved by masses, and make some money of it. Silly indeed.

## Why it failed

I soon found that it's easier to say that to do.

Firstly, I made the terrible mistake of choosing XML as a data format. Making levels and AI in XML is great pain, so making more advanced stuff is really hard.

The second reason why the goal was never achieved is that I didn't have the sufficient time and knowledge to code it.

The truth is that I started making the game with absolutely no knowledge of computer graphics, more so of OpenGL. That's why the graphics are just GL1.2, and really clumsy.

## But it's fun anyway!

All in all, I think Sector is a decent space shooter, and even if it doesn't have the adventure mode, it is still a lot of fun. Not even I can beat some (or most) of the scores people have made over the time.

*Let's go challenge the space monsters, build the best ship and show them who's the Master of Cosmos!*
