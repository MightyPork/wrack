$ Lores is a lightweight JavaScript library for drawing big pixels on canvas, and reading user input from mouse and keyboard.

If you want to make a *retro-themed game* such as snake, tetris or space invaders, or just want to *draw something pixel-by-pixel*, then Lores is the ideal library for you.

**But there is more:** Lores can not only draw; it also takes care of sprites, mouse and keyboard, and can even load images from files.

# How it's done

The base component for Lores is a **HTML5 canvas element**, which is segmented into big pixels and treated as a super-low-resolution screen. If you want a pixel that will cover half of your screen, no problem.
